=== eVend devices ===

All eVend devices (more or less) respect following command addressing scheme.
Like "standard" MDB devices:
- base+0 (example: 40,78) - RESET
- base+1 (41,79) - SETUP (long response with firmware version, etc)
- base+3 (43,7B) - POLL (often returns 1 byte)
eVend specific:
- base+2 (42,7A) XX... - device specific commands
- base+4 (44,7C) 02 - get error code, call this when POLL returns byte with 08 bit mask set (08, 0c, 48, etc)
- base+5 (45,7D) XX... - device specific configuration
- base+6 (46,7E) 02 XX... - upgrade firmware block 16 byte.
- base+6 (46,7E) 03 XX XX - finish firmware upgrade, XX XX may be checksum.
In device sections below, only unique commands are listed.

After RESET devices enter inactive state for 2s. During this time:
- POLL works fine
- physical action (base+2) commands result in either timeout or NAK, depending on firmware

Two types of protocol has been observed:
- (type1) hoppers, mixer, elevator
  During inactive state, action (base+2) commands do not respond (timeout).
  POLL returns empty response (idle or busy) or 2 bytes:
  0D 00 - success
  04 XX - error code XX
  05 0B - previous request was invalid. Does not respond (timeout) to actual invalid request.
  POLL does not indicate distinction between idle and busy state.
- (type2) valve, conveyor, cup, coffee
  During inactive state, action (base+2) commands respond with NAK.
  Invalid request (like garbage) responds with NAK, next POLL sets bit 20.
  Valid request with invalid arguments responds with ACK, next POLL sets bit 20.
  POLL returns empty response for success or 1 byte with bit mask values:
  - 04 - soft-timeout? Sending POLL more often makes this disappear.
  - 08 - error, must call base+4 02 to get documented error code
  - 10 - busy, for some devices busy response is 50
  - 20 - previous request was invalid. Responds NAK to actual invalid request.
In device sections below, only unique POLL responses are listed.


=== Hoppers ===

Protocol type1.

May have separate address per hopper or multiplexer board (каретка) with a single address.
Base addresses of hopper boards:
- 1 - 40
- 2 - 48
- 3 - 50
- 4 - 58
- 5 - 60
- 6 - 68
- 7 - 70
- 8 - 78
- multiplexer - B8

Individual hopper commands:
base+2 (42,5A,etc) XX - run motor for XX * 0.1s

Multiplexer commands:
BA XX YY - run motor XX for YY * 0.1s


=== Valve block (C0) ===

Protocol type2.

Commands:
C4 11 - get hot water temperature (1 byte)
C5 10 YY - set temperature YY degrees Celsius

C2 01 YY - pour hot water for YY units (1.538462 ml)
C2 02 YY - pour cold water for YY units (1.538462 ml)
C2 03 YY - pour espresso water for YY units (1.538462 ml)
C2 10 YY - cold valve (YY: 1=open / 0=close)
C2 11 YY - hot valve (YY: 1=open / 0=close)
C2 12 YY - boiler valve (YY: 1=open / 0=close)
C2 13 YY - espresso pump (YY: 1=start / 0=stop)
C2 14 YY - pump (YY: 1=start / 0=stop)

POLL response unique bits:
10 - busy pouring water, other commands do not indicate busy state
40 - hot temperature not in range

Examples:
C4 11 -> 17 -- what is hot water temp? 22C
C5 10 55 -- make it 85C
C3 -> 44 -- hot temp. not in range and should repeat POLL
C2 01 4E -- pour 120ml of hot water
C3 -> 10 -- busy pouring water


=== Mixer (C8) / Elevator (D0) ===

Protocol type1.

Same PCB, device address is chosen with 4th DIP switch: on=elevator (lift), off=mixer.

Mixer:
CA 01 XX YY - shake (run motor for XX * 0.1s, YY: speed 0-100%, 00-64 hex)
CA 02 XX 00 - fan (XX: 01=on / 00=off)
CA 03 XX 64 - move mixer up/down (XX: 0-100%, 00-64 hex) (this command is called "reverse")

Elevator:
D2 03 XX 00 - move elevator up/down (XX: 0-100%, 00-64 hex)

Error codes:
20 motor high load


=== Conveyor (D8) ===

Protocol type2. Busy response is always 50, ignore bit 40.

Commands:
DD 10 XX - set speed. Range 500 .. 200 steps/s. 1C=500 3C=200. Unit=15steps/s.

DA 01 LO HI - move to position (HI>>8)+LO
DA 03 YY 00 - shake YY times - rapid forward-backward movement

Important notes:
- After RESET, must execute MOVE to 0 to calibrate motor driver.

Error codes:
17 move error - not fatal, may try to reset and retry


=== Cup dispenser (E0) ===

Protocol type2. Busy response is always 50, ignore bit 40.

Commands:
E2 01 - dispense cup
E2 02 - turn on leds
E2 03 - turn off leds
E2 04 - ensure cup is available

Important notes:
- Must execute ENSURE before each DISPENSE.
- DISPENSE must contain one POLL=busy (cup is dropped) right after command. Immediate POLL=empty is sensor error.
- DISPENSE/ENSURE will rotate tubes until cup is available or ~40s timeout resulting in error=15.

Error codes:
15 out of cups


=== Coffee (espresso) (E8) ===

Protocol type2. Busy response is always 50, ignore bit 40.

Commands:
EA 01 - grind
EA 02 - press grounds into tablet
EA 03 - release tablet (motor runs until top position sensor opens circuit)
EA 05 - TODO (seemingly) turn on tablet heating
EA 06 - TODO (seemingly) turn off tablet heating

Important notes:
- GRIND must contain at least 500ms busy state.
- Jammed grinder creates low resistance circuit which makes power supply drop voltage.
- PRESS/RELEASE commands ignore absent/dysfunctional motor: POLL responds busy for 2.18s, then success (empty response).
- PRESS/RELEASE commands ignore absent sensors: will spin for (TODO time), then success (empty response).

Error codes:
3C press sensor
3D release sensor
3E out of coffee
3F dispenser (dose) sensor
41 dispenser (dose) high load
